Griffines Onyango Oduol
Hi my name is Griffins, I get so exited by code, learning new technologies, expanding my network, engaging in fun activities such as road trip, swimming, going for walks. My journey in tech has not been smooth but all together it has been so exiting and getting through to this point has made me more aggressive and hungry to better my future self. I'm a full stalk developer. I develop front end application with these technologies: HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, VUEJS, JAVASCRIPT. Back end: PYTHON, JAVASCRIPT, PHP and frameworks such as DJANGO, FLASK, LARAVEL, EXPRESSJS
